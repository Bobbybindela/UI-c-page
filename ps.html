                <p>Parents today are increasingly concerned about the safety and well-being of their children, especially regarding school attendance and safety during playtime in designated areas. We are seeking innovative proposals for a system that can track a child&apos;s school attendance and monitor their location during play. The system should feature:</p>

                <h6 class="fw-bold">Boundary Alert System:</h6> 
                <p>Define a specific safety boundary (e.g., 100 meters) around the child&apos;s play area, with an alert system that notifies parents if the child crosses this boundary.</p>
                <h6 class="fw-bold">Parental Notifications:</h6>
                <p>Real-time alerts should be sent to parents via a mobile app or SMS, informing them if the child misses school or leaves the designated play area.</p>
                <h6 class="fw-bold">Mobile App/Web Dashboard:</h6>
                <p>A user-friendly mobile app for parents to receive alerts and track their child&apos;s attendance and location, along with a detailed web dashboard that provides comprehensive reports and settings.</p>

                <p>A critical challenge in piston manufacturing arises from irregularities in the outer bore diameter following the finishing processes. For instance, after completing the finishing process, a piston with an expected diameter of 49.99 mm experiences a reduction of 20 microns. This variation in bore diameter compromises the overall quality and performance of the piston. The goal is to develop a solution that eliminates these inconsistencies and ensures precise, reliable, and consistent bore diameters throughout the manufacturing process.</p>
